GXBH
GxBase Helper Projects, more or less..

WARNING: THIS REPOSITORY IS SUBJECT TO DRASTIC CHANGES WITHOUT NOTICE!
EVEN DELETION... KEEP WHAT YOU REALLY DONT WANT TO LOSE!

The projects here are pre-anything but are in synch with GxBase since i think
once the project is planned, things that are used will be kept, sorted out
and re-organized. Unless you are using this source there is no reason for you
to need to compile any of this (unless of course you are working on the
project). Forks are okay, none of this stuff is really too serious since I've
not as much time (hopefully summer break will free up some time).

Don't forget to read the (probably outdated) other README-s in the repo.

This came from: gitorious.org/+paradisim/gxbh
this is where all my projects come from
