  nopwlog README

	a (very) small program to reduce resource use on terminals waiting for local login
	WARNING: logins do not require passwords, hence the name 'nopwlogin'

	USAGE

	To use this program, you will need root privs, and hopefully the administrator's permission!

	Example (for systems using upstart)

	open your /etc/init/tty1.conf (or whatever tty you are editing)
  your tty file should have a line like this:

	  exec /sbin/getty -8 38400 tty1

	simply add "-nl /bin/nopwlog" (assuming you placed nopwlog in /bin) to the
	same command line to make it look like this:

		exec /sbin/getty -nl "/bin/nopwlog" -8 38400 tty1

	in this instance, quotes are not required. However, if you use a path/file combination
	that contains spaces or special characters you WILL need them!

	MAKE SURE you do not touch any other part of the tty1.conf unless you know what you are doing!


	OTHER USES

	Not sure, let me know: osirisgothra@hotmail.com
	Made this for myself, there are probably many more like it!
